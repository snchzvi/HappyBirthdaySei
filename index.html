        <p class="justified">
          You are utterly ethereal and a saint in every way. It amazes me how lucky I am to have you in my life. You mean so much to me, and my love for you grows more with each passing day. You are just so perfect, and that‚Äôs the simple truth.<br><br>
          You‚Äôve become my reason to wake up, to smile, and to live, just so I can keep loving you, making you smile, giving you anything you want, and protecting you from this cruel world. You are my angel, my world, and my love for you will never grow cold. Just being with you makes me so happy. Everything feels lighter and better when I‚Äôm with you. You bring light and warmth, especially to me.<br><br>
          There‚Äôs so much I admire about you. You are a strong, independent woman, and I love how well you take care of yourself. But even though you can, I want you to know that you have me now. When things get hard, or even when they don't, you can always rely on me.<br><br>
          I love how sweet you are to me, that softness you have, and that pretty, pretty smile of yours. I love it so much. I hope today makes you feel all the love and happiness you give so effortlessly.<br><br>
          Thank you for being mine. I can‚Äôt wait to keep making memories with you. Today is the first of your birthdays that we‚Äôre celebrating together, and I‚Äôm so excited for many more.<br><br>
          Happy Birthday, my love, my heart, my amazing girlfriend !!!<br>
